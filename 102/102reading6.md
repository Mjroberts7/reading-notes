Fascinating history: What one home router can do - The WRT54GL

This matters in relation to what I'm learning because this could be an option for an open source router for future use. Also to know there is out there some hacker who could be utilizing this technology. 

1. What makes the Linksys WRT54GL famous? The Linksys  WRT54GL is famous for being customizable. It is older so the factory stuff can be taken off and custom builds/hotspots can be installed on it. 
2. Given its age, why do people continue to buy the Linksys WRT54GL? People still buy it because of the customization available. It is built for open-source and is good for it.   
3. What does the “WRT54GL” stand for in the name? WRT stands for Wireless Router. 54 stands for the speed in Mbps. G is for 802.11g. Last the L stands for Linux. 
4. What did Linksys sell before routers? Linksys sold routers that didn't have wireless capability. 
5. When did Linksys preview their first consumer router? November 1999 was the time that Linksys first previewed their first consumer router. 
6. Who suggested to name it a “router”? None other than Bill Gates suggested the name 'router' in 1999. 
7. What happened when Cisco replaced the Linux-based firmware with the VxWorks platform? When Cisco did this it made it difficult to flash open-source(Linux) firmware and people through a fit so they changed it back. 
8. Why doesn’t the WRT54GL model need to be modified to abide by the new FCC rules? It doesn't affect he WRT54GL model because the new rules only apply to 5G products
9. Does the WRT54GL model still get updates from Linksys? It does still get firmware updates from the manufacturer but they do not affect users.
