Knowing the difference between SSD and HDD can help you in troubleshooting a faulty one as well as help in your preference of which one you decide for your system. 


1. What are some common indicators that an SSD may be failing?
- trying to manipulate or altering files/file locations may result in failures. Apps may fail or run slow. and prompts to repair the system pop up alot. 
2. How do SSD failures differ from HDD failures in terms of detectability?
- HDD failures can be more obvious due to their structural design. They may make noise while SSD's are quiet. 
3. What are bad blocks in an SSD, and how do they affect its performance?
- They are specific spaces in storage that are unretrievable or corrupt because of improper storage.
4. How can power cycling an SSD help resolve certain issues?
- Power cycling an SSD doesnt let data travel to the SATA cable and therefor will make the SSD run solely off of power. This performs a sort of back up of the SSD. 
5. How might this topic be relevant in the aftermath of a natural disaster? Describe how individuals or communities can use these techniques to recover data and resume their normal activities.
- A natural disaster could cause faulty SSD's through lightning strikes or water and show no physical signs on the SSD. However if you know the signs of a faulty one, then you can either fix or replace it depending on the damage you assessed and steps you took to resolve it.
