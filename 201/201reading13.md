## Reading notes 13
AWS and the cloud are gaining exponential popularity among major technology companies. The rising popularity has called for more and more professionals to handle and secure the platforms. The roles are out there for people who take the time to master them. 

1. How has virtualization evolved beyond desktops and servers?
- It has expanded to include networks, storage(cloud), data devices, and applications. 
2. In the context of the Amazon IaaS Cloud Service Model, what does EC2 stand for?
- EC2 stands for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
3. What types of storage does EC2 use, and how is EC2 web traffic managed?
- it uses Ephermeral which is temporary storage, and Elastic Block Storage which is snapshots stored in Amazon S3. 
4. What are the benefits of service-oriented architecture for customers of EC2 virtualized services?
- The biggest benefit is the ability to control all of the virtualization through web interfaces instead of physically traveling around the world. 
5. Analyze how cloud virtualization can promote equitable access to technology resources across diverse populations. How can this technology bridge cultural gaps and empower underserved communities?
- Everybody that has a specific goal in the world can come together on the same platform with the same goal in mind and work towards it safely and securely at the same time. There is no need for worldly travel if all of the goals can be achieved through virtualization.
