Reading
Getting to know the command line operations is critical to being a tech professional since a lot of applications and checks require specific command line arguments. Some applications don't even have a GUI to virtualize, just run through commands. 


1. How can you list the files in the current directory using the command prompt?
- ls will list the files in a directory when using a Linux computer. Command Prompt however uses the command dir to list all of the files or folders within the current directory. 
2. How might the “sfc” command and the “gpupdate” command help in troubleshooting on Windows?
- The sfc scan stands for system file checker and will scan all of the important files, check for broken/corrupt files to the best of its ability, and repair them. Very handy command. The gpupdate command will force updates to be applied to a computer. It forces a target computer to apply group update policies. 
3. What advantages does the “robocopy” command offer over the “xcopy” command, and why is it useful for file transfers in certain situations?
- The two commands are very similar but the robocopy command has some unique features that make it a more viable command, such as the ability to resume a file transfer that has been interrupted. 
4. Think about any real-life scenarios from your cultural context where the use of command line tools could be beneficial. Describe one such scenario and explain how a specific command line tool would help address the situation.
- One scenario that would be helpful for anybody to use the command line is when you need to check if a specific application or directory is installed on the computer and where it is installed. The command line will tell you exactly which version of the application is installed and where it is installed. So if you can't find an application just go through the listed directories until you find the application and run --version to see if the version installed is the newest/correct version.
