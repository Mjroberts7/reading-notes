SOP is incorporated in every technology company and is specific for organizations

1. What is a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), and why is it important for an organization?
- SOP's are procedures that describe how to perform a task, and they are important for organizations because every organization has specific ones. 
2. What are the three types of documents that should be included in an SOP manual? Briefly describe each type.
- a. Policy - broad general guidance
- b. SOP - The what, when, and why for tasks. 
- c. work instructions - provides the how for something to be done. 
3. Why are SOPs considered a primary way to implement or enforce policies in an organization?
- SOP's are what cements the policies to being enforceable and promotes mission success. 
4. What does the author emphasize regarding the audience when writing SOPs, and why is it essential to consider them?
- The author emphasizes that the audience must be "able" to read the SOPs and understand them. If there are not clear, measureable, and understandable then the audience is not going to even pay attention to them. 
5. Imagine you are a part of a multicultural team responsible for following an SOP. How would you address potential misunderstandings or differing interpretations of the procedure due to cultural differences? Propose strategies to foster effective cross-cultural communication.
-  I would propose clear algorithmic SOP's. That way each step or policy is simple and understandable. I would make sure each employee is familiar with it as well through their orientation.
