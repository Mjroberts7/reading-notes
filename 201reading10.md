BDR is very important to have for in case situations. Without BDR system recovery is non-existant.


1. What is Backup and Disaster Recovery (BDR), and why is it essential for businesses?
- BDR is the process of storing data in a location for safekeeping or just in case purposes. It is essential for businesses because if something goes wrong, say ransomware or some files/accounts became corrupted, the data can be loaded back. 
2. Describe the process of data backup in detail.
- the process of storing data the cloud or physical drive. 
3. What does disaster recovery refer to, and why is it crucial to have it in addition to data backups?
- following a plan or procedure that is laid out in a cybersecurity framework of storing data in cloud or physical drive and having the data readily available should the situation arise that it is needed for business continuity. 
4. What is cloud backup and recovery, and how does it enhance data security?
- Cloud backup is storing the data not on a physical drive but in a cloud environment. This adds a layer of protection and allows the backup to be restored without having the physical external hard drive on hand. 
5. In some cultures, the concept of data privacy is highly valued, while in others, sharing information openly is considered normal. How might these cultural norms affect the way individuals approach data backup and disaster data recovery? Provide examples to support your response.
- for the person that is open about sharing information. It could be an issue with security. They also may not back up their system very much. For example if you backed up your data to the cloud and then told someone where those files were located, then those files could potentially be hacked if enough word of mouth gets around. For the person who highly values data privacy, they might back up their system alot and have good security
