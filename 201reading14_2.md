## Pyschological safety reading


Discussion Questions
1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
- Norms, collective conversation, social sensitivity
2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
- My military career, the last few years especially, I worked in a group setting and this psychological research has some truth to it. The team I worked with had better and more effective results when the group norm, or the social sensitivity of the group, was positive. When a leader came in and did not fit in well with the group, the whole group dynamic and results diminished. Work was not done as effective and the people lost motivation to work/challenge the mind. 
3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
- They make the group dynamic shine. They bring the collective intelligence up which in turn leads to efficiency and increased production.
