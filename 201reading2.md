1. What is the primary function of a shell in a computerâ€™s operating system?
   - A shell is an application that runs other applications that interact with your operating system directly.

   - Bash will search directories on the operating system to see if the command exists. If it does it will read and run the command to execute it. 
3. How can you determine if your system is running a Bash shell?
   - you can determine that your system is running bash by using the echo command. The echo command will take a variable to determine the program it is running. 
4. What makes Bash scripting powerful and why is it considered scriptable?
   - Bash scripting is so powerful and is considered scriptable because every command that can run on bash can also be written up on a text document (such as notepad) and a command can be run on bash to read/run the text document. 
5. Bash scripting allows for customization, automation, and efficiency. Discuss methods or practices from your previous work experience or cultural background that aim to achieve similar goals in daily tasks.
