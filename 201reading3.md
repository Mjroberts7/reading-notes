Introduction to Help Desk Support Roles

Learning about what help desk support roles do is important because they are the most common entrance job into the cyber/technology career field. It would be hard to find a job now that the company doesn't apply at least some sort of technology even if it is something as simple as Microsoft Office. All of them need a tech professional who can help whenever there is a bug, update, or any technology-related issue. 

1. What role does the help desk professional play within an organization, particularly in relation to customers?
- Help desk professionals are the direct line between the customer and the product. They are the first person the customer will turn to when any issue with the technology arises. 
2. The article differentiates between hard and soft skills. In your culture or community, are there specific skills that are highly valued? How do they compare to the skills mentioned in the article?
- Some skills that my community values are knowledge expertise and charisma. My community has a lot of older people who don't understand technology and are against it. They would much rather someone deal with the technology for them or avoid it. So when they get someone who is knowledgeable and able to help them they prefer it. The skills would match the troubleshooting and personal skills in the article. They don't even want to hear the fix, they just want to know that it is fixed and the tech professional is confident it will work. 
3. Why have security skills become more important in recent years for help desk technicians?
- Security has become more important in recent years because of the increased availability or common application of technology, the average criminal has gotten smarter. Malware has increased which calls for more security to protect valuable data/assets. 
4. How do writing skills and critical thinking skills play a vital role in the work of help desk technicians?
- Writing skills help convey steps taken to resolve troubleshooting problems. Critical thinking skills help technicians think outside the box so that they are equipped to handle any problem that is thrown their way.
