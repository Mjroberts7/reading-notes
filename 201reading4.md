CompTIA A+ 220-902 Troubleshooting Methodology

1. What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?
- Document all of the issues to understand the full scope of the problem. Identify what is going wrong and try and identify why each issue is happening. Ask questions to the customer to figure out when this problem arose and how. 
2. What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?
- Once a solution has been identified you implement the course of action with a game plan. That game plan should also have a plan b in case it did not fix it. Try to think of all possible scenarios. 
3. What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?
- Documentation can save your skin in troubleshooting because you can find exactly where a mess up in the solution was implemented or could find a bug that needs to be fixed, just like having a save state on a desktop. Documentation can be read to find out exactly what the problem was, what caused it, and how it was fixed.  
4. Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?
- There is a multitude of devices I could pick from but one I will just pick as an example is a ceiling fan. Mainly because I just had to dix my own ceiling fan. If a light goes out in the ceiling fan, you first check to see if the bulb is broken. If the bulb is fine then it could be a few issues. You have to think about the circuit. Where in the circuit a problem could be, which is usually the terminal points. Those terminal points are the bulb/socket, the transformer/inverter box within the ceiling fan, the light switch, and then the breaker. It would probably be smart to check the breaker first as that is easiest to see if the breaker is off. then check the light switch. If the fan worked, then the switch is fine. My issue was the transformer box in my ceiling fan. I just had to order the same P/N and wire it in. There could be bad wiring connections within the circuit if the lights are connected in tandem with other wiring but that is a separate individual case.
