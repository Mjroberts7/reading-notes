Reading
CompTIA A+ 220-902 Troubleshooting Methodology

What should you do if multiple issues are happening simultaneously during troubleshooting?
- Document all of the issues to understand the full scope of the problem. Identify what is going wrong and try and identify why each issue is happening. Ask questions to the customer to figure out when this problem arose and how. 
What should be done once a successful solution has been identified during the troubleshooting process?
- Once a solution has been identified you implement the course of action with a game plan. That game plan should also have a plan b incase it did not fix it. Try to think of all possible scenario's. 
What are the benefits of documenting the entire troubleshooting process in a knowledge base?
-
Think about a technological device particularly popular in your culture or community. Imagine a scenario where issues arise: how would you apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting methodology to help, while considering the end-userâ€™s cultural background?
