5. How does the concept of “security” in Windows Defender Security Center relate to your own experiences in keeping your personal belongings safe? Share some strategies you use to protect your belongings and how they might parallel the security measures used in the digital world.
- I keep my belongings tucked away in a secret place that i dont think anybody knows and if it an obvious place then i put it in a hard to penetrate place and put a lock on it. This is exactly what the digital ages does also with the obvious stuff being "locked" with a digital key and the less obvious stuff being hidden in files that only one person should know. They are very similar.
