It is important to know what the windows registry is because there is important configuration settings that can be applied to programs from here. Knowing how to apply these settings can be crucial to technology jobs.  

1. What is the Windows Registry, and what does it store?
- The windows registry is a folder like container that contains settings such as keys and values that configure the machine. 
2. What are the two types of registry settings stored for each Windows user account?
-The two types of registry settings stored are keys and values. 
3. What are “registry hacks” and why might someone want to use them?
- If you want settings that are normally only on professional editions you can hack it and edit the settings. 
4. What are some common tasks you can perform by editing the Windows Registry?
- Display a message at sign in and block user accounts from running specific apps are two common tasks you can edit. 
5. Imagine you’re explaining the concept of the Windows Registry to someone who has never used a computer before. How would you make this explanation culturally relevant and relatable to their life experiences or background?
- I would explain it in a way it is kind of like a vault that hides all of the money and valuables. the money in your vault gives you access to change your surrounding. For example if you wanted to buy a new couch and customize your living room, you would take money out of the vault(registry) to go pick a couch you want(setting) and that couch is now your key\value pair for your house made excessable by the money.
