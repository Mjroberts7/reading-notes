Privacy is a major consumer product that we can use to leverage to our career opportunities. 


1. How can one host within a VPC any services that need to be public? They use a vpn and use the vpc resources to access the internet.
2. What are examples of services that would live in the publicly-accessible part of the VPC? The privately-accessible part? the private iP address are privately accesssable. Traffic passing in and out of the VPC with a VPN will not be accessable to other public cloud users.  
3. What are the trade-offs of using a VPC vs traditional infrastructure? The instant availability and access to resources without physical device interaction. It is simple to connect. The security updates and maintaining is esier and more accessable as well.
