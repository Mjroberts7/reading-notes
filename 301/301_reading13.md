1. What exactly is “Active Directory” and are the key services it provides? It is a directory controller pretty much that is used to authenticate and control users, as well as the resources provided to them.

2. What are the differences between a domain, forest, and tree in Active Directory? The forest is made up of trees, and the trees are made up of domains. The forests is the security boundary point for a network. a tree is where the dns root name is stored. a domain is the collection of objects that is identified by a dns name that is like a typical website name.

3. How can objects (e.g. users, devices) within a domain be grouped? They can be grouped by organizational units or OU's. Admins set up and apply group policies to OU's.

4. Explain the benefits of Active Directory, as you would to a family member. Active directory is great for business's as it helps to control the resources available so security is the main front. Having all of the settings for a organization centralized makes access and vulnerabilities at a minimum.
