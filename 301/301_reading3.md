## Reading notes 3


1. What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block? CIDR notation is a a way to represent CIDR blocks which is an IP address range. 
2. How many octets are found in an IPv4 address? there are 4 octects in each IP address. 
3. Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet? 0-255
4. What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address? that represents how many bits make up the mask. 
5. How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24? 256 IP addresses

1. In your own words, describe network segmentation. Splitting up a network using different resources, such as firewalls and routers.  
2. Network segmentation isn’t important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not? No I dont agree. I believe that understanding networks fully is the best option. Firewalls can become obsolete in the future and then we really need to know how to segment a network. 
3. What is a screened subnet? a network with a single firewall and three network interfaces.
4. Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security? This is called physical security.
