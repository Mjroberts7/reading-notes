Traffic mirroring can let techology experts see exactly where someone made a breach or there is a bug. It helps with troubleshooting and securing systems. 

1. What are the differences between SPAN and TAP? SPAN is port mirroring and TAP stands for Terminal Access Point amd just captures traffic. 
2. What types of network devices can support network traffic mirroring? Can be done from any network device that can passively capture network traffic from a switch. 
3. How can network traffic mirroring be used for network security? They are non-obtrusive, not detectable on the network, can handle full-duplex to non-shared networks, and losing power isnt an issue. 
4. Are there any legal or ethical considerations when using network traffic mirroring? There is a thin line on where the legality is drawn on this practice. Accessing unauthorized data can happen fast and when it does that is when you step over the legal lines.
