## Reading Notes 12
Domain controlllers and group policies are a valuable tool to understand in the industry becuase they are prominent in technology career field. 

1. Explain the role of a Domain Controller? The domain controller is in control of the domain settings such as user accounts and computers on the domain.
2. What is the benefit of being able to login with the same username and password on any computer joined to the domain? What are the security risks? The ability to remotely control devices is a huge advantage for companies that let employees work remote. Group policy settings override local settings on computers so the computers and settings can all be controlled from one place. A disadvantage is if the DNS controller has been compromised, then that leaves every computer they are in charge of compromised as well. DNS attacks are very prominent and can easy to do once access to the domain controller is exploited.
3. Describe how group policies are used in domains? Group policies override any local policies that the individual computers set up. It is the policies the domain controller can set up to be applied to the whole domain. 
4. In what other ways can you think of that domains could be used beyond what was presented in the reading? You could use a domain to temporarily join for the purpose of installing software that the domain controller offers. Such as a group that invented some kind of software that they are selling commercially. They wouldnt want that information open source. So, they could create a domain and whoever wants it could join the domain, distribute the software, then leave the domain.
