## Reading notes 2
Understanding ports is a way to understand how your network works. 

1. What is a port? Describe it with an analogy that would help a family member understand. A port is a specific virtual location that allows packet traffic. It is like a interstate with as many lanes as there are ports open. Each car can only go to the end and start destination and is carrying data that is important for both destinations.
2. What does a port scanner send to a port to check the current status? It sends a TCP or UDP network packet and waits for the status.
3. When a port scanner sends a request to connect, what are the three possible responses? Describe them. Open, Accepted - Computer asks what it can do for us. Closed, Not listening - computer says port is in use and unavailable. Filtered, Dropped, Blocked - Computer doesn't respond. 
4. What is the difference between TCP and UDP? TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol and confirms that each packet transmission is successful. UDP stands for User datagram protocol and just sends packets without confirming anything.
