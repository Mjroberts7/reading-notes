1. In your own words, describe network segmentation. Splitting up a network using different resources, such as firewalls and routers.  
2. Network segmentation isn’t important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not? 
3. What is a screened subnet?
4. Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security?
