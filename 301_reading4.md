## Reading Notes 4
Virtual Box creates a safe environment for testing. Learning the best settings configurations can be crucial for when problems arise. 

1. Which network mode in VirtualBox can be used to emulate unplugging the Ethernet cable from the network?  Not Attached
2. Which network mode would be best if you wanted to run a server on a VM that could be fully accessible from your physical local area network? Bridged Adapter
3. What are the three options of promiscuous mode and what does each do? Deny - traffic not intended for the VM is not seen by the VM, Allow VMs - all traffic is hidden except traffic to and from VM's, Allow All - no restrictions so the VM network adapter can see all traffic. 
4. What is Port Forwarding? Intercepting port traffic and redirecting the traffic to a different IP address and port.
