NGINX may be handy later when i am dealing with a large work load and need a fast server. 


1. What are some common use cases for NGINX? web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming. 
2. How does NGINX handle tasks that could slow down the web server? It takes them and uses event driven asynchronous architechture to speed up the process. They specialize in high, fast performance in server performance. 
3. Describe, as if to a non-technical friend how to actually pronounce “NGINX”, and why an org might chooose to use it. I would pronounce it engine x. An org might choose to use it if they need a server that can handle a large load output and also be fast. 

I got information from these sites
