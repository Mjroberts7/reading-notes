## Mj's Reading notes

## Reading notes 8
These concepts are the core of security for the internet and will be valuable resources for our careers.

1. Explain each of the three Aâ€™s as you would to a non-technical family member. Use an analogy or a story. Authentication is making sure only the person who is permitted is allowed through credentials. Authorization is making sure only the necessary resources are available/permitted to the authenticated user. Accounting is monitoring that the first two factors are followed and logged into a record. 
2. What should the administrator do if the ACS server fails to authenticate a user during AAA implementation? The administrator should mention using a local database of the device as a backup.
3. What is the role of the NAS in the AAA implementation using an ACS server? Use a diagram. the Network Access Server (NAS) ![Alt text](<Screenshot 2023-12-05 105703.png>)

1. What are the benefits of using RADIUS for authentication and authorization? It provides a central database for better security and easier access to statistics and billiing. 
2. What is RADIUS and what does it stand for? RADIUS is a software and protocol that enables Remote Access Servers to communicate with a central server and stands for Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service.
3. Research: What encryption algorithms does RADIUS use? It uses the 802.1x authentication access protocol to mediate access. It uses PAP(Password Authentication Protocol) and CHAP (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol) to authenticate.
