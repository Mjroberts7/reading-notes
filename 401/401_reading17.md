1. What are some of the key features of the VPC model? Agility, or the control of size of your virtual network. Availibility, or the resources zone that allows you to access them from anywhere. Security, no shared space with other users. Affordability, saving on hardware, labor, or other costs from physical architecture.
2. What are the three tiers that comprise the three-tier architecture model? - The web or presentation layer, the appliation tier, and the database tier. 

Compute - VSI's (virtual servers) presented as virtual CPU's. Storage - self explanitory. Networking - virtual versions of networks such as gateways, load balancers, and routers. 
3. Describe the differences between a VPC and a VPN to someone you know from your previous job. A VPN connects to the public internet through a secure tunnel. A VPC is the secured network in the cloud.
