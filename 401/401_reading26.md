# Mj's Reading Notes

## Reading notes 26

1. You just got a new job as a Cyber Threat Analyst, how would you explain your role to a family member? I am someone who uses my skills and knowledge in networks and cybersecurity to prevent threats and vulnerabilities on the systems. 
2. Explain what makes PowerShell such an effective attack vector. PowerShell is an ideal channel for attackers because of its wide deployment and access to all parts of a host. Also, because PowerShell is a trusted application, it will almost always be allowed to execute scripts.
3. What are two things you can do to mitigate attacks that leverage PowerShell? configure the group policy and enabling module logging.
