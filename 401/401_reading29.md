## Reading notes 29

1. Explain threat modeling using real-world non-technical examples. threat modeling is like preparing for the worse by finding the flaws. For example if someone built a wood burning stove they would need to build a fire in it and check to make sure smoke is not pouring out the side of it first. This ensures there is no flaws in the design. 
2. What are the four questions that can help us organize threat modeling? 
- What are we working on?
- What can go wrong?
- What are we going to do about it?
- Did we do a good job?
3. You are the project lead for a new application. How would you explain the benefits of Threat Modeling to the rest of the team? Threat modeling shows the possible avenues that a threat could take, giving us insight into the attackers POV. With this in mind we can prepare our securities according to what would prevent them access.
