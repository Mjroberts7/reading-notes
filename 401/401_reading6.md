# Mj's Reading notes

# Reading notes 6 (skipped 5)

1. You have been made responsible for the companyâ€™s file server. How would you preserve the three elements of the CIA triad? I would incorporate Encryption as much as possible. the data-at-rest and data-in-transit.Or a better term end-to-end encryption.
2. Explain how hashing verifies data integrity using non-technical terms. Hashes are unique in that no two are the same. One little number or letter difference and the hash i completely different. So when there is an alteration the hash could look completely different. And if they look similar you can do a hash comparison. 
3. How is hashing and encryption different? Hashing is easier to crack/break. Encryption provides a means of authentication into it. 

I got information for these notes from
