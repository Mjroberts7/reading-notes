1. How would you convince your organization about the importance of implementing a DLP solution? Data loss prevention could be the most important software that a company invests in. There is a saying that i hear called data is king right now. Someone getting ahold of your data can cause catastrophe and lossing it can cost the whole business. That is why having preventive measures to not loss it is essential for companies that deal with data. 
2. How would you explain the three main use cases for DLP to friends or family? 
- PII not getting out to the public is preached at every company that you work at. You have to keep that personal information private or identifty fraud could happen to the people whose data is in the system. 
- The second use case is ip protection or intellectual property protection. This deals with the company itself and not the customers. If the company has specific property (intellectual, financial to name a few) you want to have measures in place to protect their loss. 
- The third use case of a DLP is data visibility. You can have full coverage of where your data is at and where it is going at all times. Data interaction is all within your scope so you never have to question where it is or what it is doing.
