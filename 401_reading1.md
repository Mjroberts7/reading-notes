SOC2 compliance helps customers with peace of mind and is an extra tool in the bag for security companies to show customers that they are trustworthy. 

1. How would you convince your future company to pursue SOC2 compliance? I would convince my future company to be SOC2 compliant by listing all of the benefits of being SOC2 complaint. There is only upsides of giving customers more peace of mind. There is not reason to fight against being compliant.
2. What are the five SOC2 Trust Principles?  Security, Confidentiality, Availability, Integrity, and Privacy. 
3. How would your explain the three levels of the SOC2 pyramid in an analogy your friends or former colleagues would understand? I would say the SOC2 Pyramid takes security policies as the foundation for the base. From the security policies stems all of the procedures that an organization would take for security. Next, the procedures make up the actual work that is performed. This is determined by the base Security policies but is actually done at the middle level. Then to round off the pyramid at the top is all of the supporting documentation. This is where the organization worker can document the steps taken to remediate/prevent any issue. Reliable and descriptive supporting documentation is crucial for not only if the issue arrises but to circle back to if similar issues arise.
