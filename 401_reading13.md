1. What are the benefits of a forward proxy? A proxy is a server that sits in front of clients and intercepts requests to communicate with a web server. They are a middleman. The benefits of a proxy is it allows anonymity, can block access to certian sites, or bypass firewalls.
2. Explain the differences between a forward and a reverse proxy? a reverse proxy sits in front of the web server instead of the client.  
3. Explain to your manager why your organization might benefit from implementing a reverse proxy? The organization would benefit from a reverse proxy by using SSL encryption on the configuring. since the origin servers are connecting to the proxy server directly instead of going through the first the information can be cached as well saving time when a new session is started.
