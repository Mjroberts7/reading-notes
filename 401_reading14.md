# Reading notes 14


1. List 2 differences between firewalls and an IDS? firewalls just block stuff. IDS's will notify if there is an incident. IDS's monitor traffic while i wouldn't say firewalls monitor traffic they are just kind of a static wall for blocking incoming/outgoing anomylies. 
2. Under what circumstances would you choose a network-based IDS over a host-based IDS? When you have alot of systems on a network and need real-time detection ability. 
3. Name 3 major drawbacks of a NIDS? They can pump out more false positives, HIDS will pick up some things that NIDS wont, and it doesnt monitor events and audit logs. 

i got info from these sites
