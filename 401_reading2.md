AWS is becoming popular and knowing how it works is important for future career options. Staying up to date is critical in the technology. 

1. Explain the levels of abstraction in AWS to someone without a technical background. The Instance abstraction, the container abstraction, The function abstraction, the bare metal abstraction, the full container abstraction. The levels of abstraction can be compared to the behind the scenes set up of virtual machines. And if that doesnt make sense neither, It is as if someone is virtually configuring a computer or its components. 
2. What are the control plane and data plane responsible for in container abstraction? The control plane is responsible for exposing the interfaces define, deploy, and lifecycle containers. the data plane is responsible for providing CPU/Memory/Network/Storage for the containers to run on a network. 
3. Where does AWS Lambda fall in the layers of abstraction and what makes it so special? The Lambda falls in the function abstraction because Lambda is an execution environment that allows a single function. You can invoke Lambda directly and trigger a Lambda function in another AWS Service. The point of Lambda is efficiency.
