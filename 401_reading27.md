While no longer maintained by its original creator as of writing, PowerShell Empire has been forked many times and was used by nation state actors from 2015-2019. The PowerShell Empire project is now actively maintained by BC Security. As you read this article, take note of its original purpose as well as the tactical advantages offered to its users.
What is one of the major advantages of PowerShell Empire?  It uses encrypted communication with the command and control server and made it difficult to detect its traffic, especially in large networks. 
What are some of the APT groups that have been known to use PS Empire and into which step of the Cyber Kill Chain does the use of PS Empire fall? It lies within the CoC(Command on Control) and AoO(Action on Object) steps of the cyber kill chain. 
What are the four main components needed to pull off an attack using PS Empire? It needs a listener, a stager, an agent, and a module.
