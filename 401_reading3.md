## Reading notes 3
Knowing the risks associated in cyber industry can help me be better prepared to tackle them.

1. Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad? They can incorporate the masking measure to only show the last 4 of the account number which alot of ATM's do use. They could also ask for a pin or other means of authentication. 
2. Name three best practices that support the CIA triad. Seperation of Duties, Mandatory vacations, and Dual control
3. What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stage’s main goal or objective? The stages of the risk management lifecycle include identifying, examining, measuring, and mitigating. There is really four stages. The stages are meant to identify risks, analysis of their potential/vulnerabilities, mitigating the threats they pose and monitoring them.
