## Reading Notes 32

1. You just started a new job as a Malware Analyst. Explain your job responsibilities to a family member. I would explain malware to them as malicious data that is intended to hurt us or cause a problem in our life through technology. Then I would say that I am the one that analyse's what exactly the malware is doing through its source and its effects. 
2. What are the six steps of the Malware Analysis process? Whatâ€™s a good mnemonic you can use to remember it? 
- Capture the malware
- Build a malware lab
- Install tools
- Record the Baseline
- Commence your investigation
- Document the results
CBIRCD I dont know how this would help anybody else but i imagine a sea bird carrying a C in its mouth This helps me memorize the Acronym. I use the Sea Bird captured the malware and is taking it out to sea. 
3. You are tasked with analyzing a new malware sample. Which type of malware analysis would you conduct first and why? Always do a static malware analysis first so you can understand the source(or at least try), And then from then you can test it in a sandbox environment.
