1. How are the stages of a pen test very similar to those of the Cyber Kill Chain? the stages of the Cyber kill chain are Reconaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and control, and Action on Object while the pen testing stages are planning and reconnaissance, scanning, gaining access, maintaining access, and analysis and WAF configuration. There are steps that are basically the same such as reconnaissance and gaining access. The processes for each can overlap each other. 
2. Your manager has asked you to explain the benefits of a pentest to the companyâ€™s leadership. How would you lead this conversation? A pen test would emulate a real world situation without any of the drawback from a real attack. The company would be able to gauge the readiness of our security and strengthen any areas that are lacking.
