1. Explain a Sniffing attack using non-technical terms. A person who wants to spy on traffic/packets of the network and then sending them back to the victim in a manner that creates a denial of service. 
2. What are the two types of sniffing attacks and what are some pros and cons of each approach? 
    - DOS(Denial of Service attack using sniffing IE Smurf attack) - this allows the attacker to see all packets but the attackers IP address is likely to be found out easily. 
    - ARP Spoofing - attacker has the arp cache which has alot of important information. This attack is not very effective unless the network is not very secure. 
3. How does encryption protect traffic against sniffing attacks? Encryption does not let the attacker get any useful information if they do happen to get ahold of the traffic since they would not be able to decipher it.
