# Mj's Reading Notes

## reading notes 7
Data and encryption understanding is very normalized/common in the workspace so it is essential to have a firm grasp on it.

1. From your day to day computer use, provide examples of when data is at rest and when it is in transit. Data is at rest when it is on stored on the computer and not being actively worked on/sitting idly. Data is in transit when you are actively transfering a file through an sftp protocol. 
2. Explain the role data encryption with regards to the CIA triad. Encryption provides Confidentiality to data to so that it doesnt get in a threat actors hand. This is good practice and should be used especially for important data. Even though it provides confidentiality, the confidentiality provideds through a secondary means integrity and availibility. It provides this because if that confidentiality is compromised than the integrity and availibility is potentially shot as well.
