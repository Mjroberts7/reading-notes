# Mj's Reading notes

## Reading notes 9 

1. Name the three main components which make up PKI. Securing websites(HTPPS) through SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) certificates. Authenticating users and computers, usually through SSH. Email and signing 
2. How would you explain, to a non-technical friend, the role PKI plays in protecting traffic between your browser and a web server. I would explain that PKI utilizes a secret key that only you know and that shows the web server that you are who you say you are. If the secret key does not amtch then it should not allow traffic.
3. What is the main weakness of the PKI architecture? The main weakness of the PKI architecture is that any certificate authority can sign a certificate for any person or computer. This leaves flaws because there is no the underlying root to the certificate origin is left inconspicuous.
