Hardware hacking is important for cybersecurity because it is one way for a hacker to infiltrate a system and exploit its weaknesses. Without knowing how hardware can be hacked or hardware components, we would not know how to protect ourselves from attacks. 

1. How is a hardware hack different than a software hack? A hardware hack is where a physical piece of hardware is bugged. This could be a chip that is implanted onto a circuit board and is sending information about the system to another party. A software hack is from within the operating system not physically on the circuit board. 
2. What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware? One way is through intercepting a device in transit from the starting point to its ending point. This interception allows time to implant bugs onto the hardware. The other way is to plant the bug from the start, or before the transit at the manufacturer level. The hacker must be smart and knowledgeable about what they are doing to pull this off. 
3. Explain how the hack worked. A small microchip was implanted onto electronic devices. When the electronic devices were received by the customers and they booted up the system, information was routed through the chip and sent to hackers. 
4. How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source? A third-party testing company that was testing servers found a small chip that wasn't supposed to be there. When investigators were researching, they found that the chips were inserted at the manufacturing phase in China.
