WikiHow - How to Build a PC: This is a longer article, so it’s OK to skim this, especially parts of the process you’re already familiar with.

This matters because being able to build and know parts of a PC is a vital to diagnosing a Technical problem if there is hardware issues. 
1. Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? This is a not so straight question. It depends on the application. For one single application higher speed is better but if a computer is running multiple applicaitons then it will need multiple cores to increase performance. Under which circumstances is that true? Each circumstance is different but for high intensity circumstances such as gaming. High speed and multiple core is perffered. How many CPU cores does a computer need? A typical, non-intense computer is good with 6 cores. 
2. What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor? A motherboard that is compatible with the CPU by checking the socket on the motherboard and seeing if it fits the CPU. 
3. What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device? You need to find a storage device that fits withing the PC. Picking between a HDD(larger, moving part with large capacity) or SSD(smaller non-moving part with smaller capacity that connects directly to motherboard). I would probably pick a SSD to save on space becuase there are options for increased capacity on external drives. 
4. Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with? I would explain to them starting off with what each one's most basic function does and in the simplest way. For example I would describe that the CPU is called the Computer Processing Unit and that it takes all the input that is given to it and processes it just like it is thinking, and then it spits out an output that it interprets. Or a Hard drive is basically a big storage container that will hold information in a certain place.
