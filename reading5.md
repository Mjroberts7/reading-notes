**Reading**
Linux command line for beginner: Read parts 1-3. The rest is a how-to guide; skim as time allows.

1. Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces?
2. What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents and rename/move files?
3. What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path?
4. Explain what Linux is, using anything except English.
