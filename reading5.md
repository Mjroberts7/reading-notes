**Reading**
Linux command line for beginner: Read parts 1-3. The rest is a how-to guide; skim as time allows.

1. Explain the terms “shell”, “terminal”, “cli”, and “command prompt”. Why are these still used today, when we have graphical interfaces? all of those terms are synonymous with each other and are all associated with the same thing. They are all the command line. They are still around today because if you know how to use them they can be more efficient than graphical interfaces. Also, some programs are only able to be open with the command line
2. What are the commands to change directories, list the file’s contents, and rename/move files? The command to change directories is 'cd'. The command to list file contents is 'ls', and the command to rename/move files is 'mv'. 
3. What are relative and absolute paths? What is special about starting with a ~ (tilde) or a ‘/’ character in the path? a relative path is a coordinate location that is almost "touching" the next file. It is related to a path nearby. A / will open a relative file if you are in a relative location. A ~ will take you to an absolute position no matter what directory you are in or where you are at in the terminal.
4. Explain what Linux is, using anything except English. Linux es un sistema operativo gratuito de código abierto.
