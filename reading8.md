Reading
What is an ISO file? Only read sections 1.1 - 1.4 inclusively.

1. What is an ISO File? An ISO file is a single file that stores an image of a much larger program that would be difficult to transfer without being converted to ISO. 
2. How do you write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removable media (like a thumb drive)? You write a file to a CD, etc by first downloading it and then either burning it to the external media or extracting and installing it. 
3. How do you create an ISO file? To create an ISO file you must download third-party software that allows you to copy the media and then create the copied media as an ISO. 
4. How do you mount an ISO file? You mount an ISO file by using an Emulator. Or if you have newer versions of windows 10 or 11 there is specific Mount options for ISO files built right in for clients.
