Command Prompt: What it is and how to use it

This is important because the CLI is where most of the work is done for technology experts. The command line is where you can access/execute commands that are not available through the GUI. 

1. What is the Command Prompt? Command Prompt is a command line interpreter and is the usual default interpreter for most computers, especially Windows. It is used to access/manipulate a multitude of information with commands.  
2. How do I access the Command Prompt? Accessing the Command Prompt is simple and usually can be done from the start menu. You search for cmd/cli, terminal, or command prompt through the start menu search feature. 
3. What are some of the most commonly used commands? Some of the most commonly used commands are chkdsk, cd, mkdir, copy, ftp, scp, del, format, ping, attrib, ssh, net, dir, help, and also shut down.
4. What is Windows Power Shell? Windows Power Shell is an updated Command Line Interpreter that Windows gives on their system in addition to Command prompt.  
5. What is Windows Terminal? Terminal is another Command-Line interpreter that mixes Powershell and Command Prompt. Terminal is kind of what each operating system has defaulted to calling the CL. If you click on Terminal it will go to whatever CLI you have configured.
